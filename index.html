          In high school, I organized and led student initiatives while writing poems 
          and essays about Ethiopia, Abay (the Nile) and diplomacy and Black history which used to be presentedby Litrature day programms in the school twice a year.. 
          These projects built my foundation in leadership and sparked my passion 
          for Political Science and International Relations.
          Female Highscool Freshman Mentoring Program- this is one of my prjecs wicked is still ongoing which is creating a sisterhood space for girls in my highschool,
          and also creating the opportunity for the seniors in the highschool to improve their Extracurriculars by giving a training for the freshman girls.

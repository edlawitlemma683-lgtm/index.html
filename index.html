    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I'm Bee, a 2nd year Political Science and International Relations (PSIR) student at AAU 🎓.  
      I’m passionate about diplomacy, working on improving my skills in technology, and creative storytelling.  
      Back in high school, I worked on projects that blended social sciences with creative writing and leadership.  
      Now, I’m exploring web design and digital tools while working on my current job to grow both professionally and personally.  
      This portfolio is a reflection of my journey — where social sciences meet digital skills.

        <p class="text-gray-600">
          In high school, I organized and led student initiatives while writing poems 
          and essays about Ethiopia, Abay (the Nile) and diplomacy and Black history which used to be presentedby Litrature day programms in the school twice a year.. 
          These projects built my foundation in leadership and sparked my passion 
          for Political Science and International Relations.
          Female Highscool Freshman Mentoring Program- this is one of my prjecs wicked is still ongoing which is creating a sisterhood space for girls in my highschool,
          and also creating the opportunity for the seniors in the highschool to improve their Extracurriculars by giving a training for the freshman girls.
          Social sciences and Consulting Club- This is a project that aimed to create this club where Socia Science stuents visual their lessons 
          by art works, litrature, theaters,  visual arts and debating through which they work on improving curiosity in the younger studets hearts aout their environment 
        and change the misconception of the society on the Socia Science Strea as less important. This includes a traning for 10th graders on how to choosetheir stream without 
        societal influence which is consulted by the seios in the school.
